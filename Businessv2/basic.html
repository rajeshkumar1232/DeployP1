        Extend and Implements
    </p>

    <p>
        extends: Used for class-to-class or abstract class inheritance. A class can only extend one other class (single inheritance).
		
    </p>

    <p>
        implements: Used for class-to-interface. A class can implement multiple interfaces, allowing for multiple inheritance in terms of behavior.
    </p>

        Abstract class and Interface with jdk8
    </p>

    <p>
        Instantiation:

Abstract Class: Cannot be instantiated directly.
Interface: Cannot be instantiated; classes implement them.
Method Types:

Abstract Class: Can contain both abstract and concrete methods.
Interface: Can contain abstract methods, default methods (concrete), and static methods (concrete).
Inheritance:

Abstract Class: Supports single inheritance (a class can extend only one abstract class).
Interface: Supports multiple inheritance (a class can implement multiple interfaces).
State:

Abstract Class: Can have instance variables (state).
Interface: Cannot have instance variables (only constants).
Use Cases:

Abstract Class: Use when you have a common base with shared behavior and state that is logically related.
Interface: Use when you want to define a contract that multiple classes can implement, regardless of their position in the class hierarchy.

    <p>
        implements: Used for class-to-interface. A class can implement multiple interfaces, allowing for multiple inheritance in terms of behavior.
