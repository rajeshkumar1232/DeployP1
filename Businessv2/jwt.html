<body>
  <p>A JWT has three parts:

	Header: Specifies the algorithm used for signing (e.g., HMAC SHA256).
	Payload: Contains the actual data, like user details (claims).
	Signature: The encoded header and payload are signed using a secret key.</p>
	
	<p>
	Steps in JWT Authorization:
Client Requests Resource:

For every subsequent request to a protected resource (e.g., /profile or /orders), the client includes the JWT in the request header (Authorization: Bearer <token>).
Server Verifies JWT:

The server checks if the JWT is valid (e.g., if the signature matches, token hasnâ€™t expired, etc.).
If valid, the server extracts the user information (claims) from the token.
Access Control:

Based on the user's roles or permissions contained in the JWT payload, the server allows or denies access to the requested resource.
Response:

If authorized, the server returns the resource.
If unauthorized, the server returns a 403 Forbidden response.</p>
